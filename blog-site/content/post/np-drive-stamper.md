# Drive Stamper

Drive Stamper is one of the first projects I released into the wild, and helped me to kick off my old blog in 2011.

It's a tool for small businesses to push files onto USB drives (or any other removable media for that matter) without the hassle of having to open up folders and drag files for every new pen drive they plug in.

Drive Stamper can detect new drives as they are connected, and can automatically copy selected files to each new drive it finds.

* Download the installer for Windows machines: [Release 1.0](https://github.com/instantiator/drive-stamper/releases/tag/1.0)
* Read the instructions on GitHub: [README.md](https://github.com/instantiator/drive-stamper/blob/master/README.md)
