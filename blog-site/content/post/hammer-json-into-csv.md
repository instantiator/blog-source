# Hammering JSON into CSV

I've built a simple tool to help hammer arbitrary JSON into CSV records.

* [instantiator/json-to-smart-csv](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv)

You're welcome to pilfer it, use it, and adapt it to your needs. If you make any modifications, do please upstream your improvements.

Download the latest binaries from:

* [instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/releases/latest](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/releases/latest)

## Getting started

Take a look in the [sample-data](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/tree/main/sample-data) directory to get a feel for the tool.

* [sample-list.json](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/blob/main/sample-data/sample-list.json) is a JSON file containing several rich objects - representing a number of fruit/vegetables found in the kitchen.
* [sample-rules.csv](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/blob/main/sample-data/sample-rules.csv) defines a number of columns to create in output CSV, and how to source them from the JSON.
* [sample-out.csv](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/blob/main/sample-data/sample-out.csv) is the output generated by the tool.

![sample output](/hammer/sample-out.csv.png "Sample output CSV file showing a record for each fruit-or-vegetable")

**(Mac OS)** You can regenerate the test output by running the [test-sample-osx-x64.sh](https://github.com/instantiator/json-to-smart-csv/blob/main/test-sample-osx-x64.sh) script.

As you can see from the script, it provides these arguments to `JsonToSmartCsv`:

* `-c sample-data/sample-rules.csv` - indicating the CSV file to find column definitions in
* `-s sample-data/sample-list.json` - indicating the source data JSON file
* `-t sample-data/sample-out.csv` - indicating the target file to put the results

By default it runs in `Create` mode - but you can switch it to append to the target file by adding the `-m Append` option.

## Future work

It's about as feature-complete as I need it to be. If you want to improve on it, or publish to a package manager of your choice, you're very welcome to do so - and do please upstream your changes.
