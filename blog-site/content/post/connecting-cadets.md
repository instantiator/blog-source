_As a volunteer with Police Rewired, I helped to develop a mobile app for the Volunteer Police Cadets. Here's why, and how..._

## Why do cadets need an app?

* TODO: notifications because safeguarding because quicker messaging (email fails, SMS is expensive)

## What about web push notifications?

* TODO: Dig up tweet about Apple supporting web push notifications in 2023

## An early prototype

* TODO: stuff about using Apache Cordova (now deprecated)

## Building an app to meet everyone's needs...

* TODO: Xamarin / cross-platform solution

## Protecting users

* TODO: a threat model
* TODO: risks and outcomes

## Open sourcing the code?

* TODO: intention, but also what steps need to be followed...
