I am a tech lead and senior software developer. My career reflects my passion for public service and volunteerism.

I'm proud of my work, including

* ...time I've volunteered founding, building, and maintaining [Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org), an open[^1] community of technologists focussed on solving problems in public safety.

[^1]: Police Rewired was open to anyone that wished to join. For clarity, the community is now closed.

* ...my contributions to One Login for Government as a part of the Digital Identity team at [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).

* ...my work at the [Centre for Collective Intelligence](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/centre-collective-intelligence-design) (CCI) at [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk), where I've been leading the development of [Zeitgeist](https://zg-app.com) - an application to deliver deliberation workshops both remotely and in-person. 

I'm also a keen [puzzle gamer](https://escapethereview.co.uk/profile/?user_id=11).

This is a personal blog, and a place to share articles and ideas.
