I am a tech lead and senior software developer. My career reflects my passion for public service and volunteerism.

I'm proud of my work across public service including...

* time I volunteered to found, build, and maintaining [Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org), an open community of technologists focussed on solving problems in public safety.

* my contributions to One Login for Government as a part of the Digital Identity team at [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).

* my work at the [Centre for Collective Intelligence](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/centre-collective-intelligence-design) (CCI) at [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk), where I've been leading the development of Zeitgeist - an application to deliver deliberation workshops both remotely and in-person. 

CCI are developing exciting new techniques and supporting tools to enable communities and groups of people of any size to devise solutions together.

I'm also a keen [puzzle gamer](https://escapethereview.co.uk/profile/?user_id=11).
