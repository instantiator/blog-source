I am a tech lead and senior software developer. My career reflects my passion for public service and volunteerism.

I'm proud of my contribution to One Login for Government as a part of the Digital Identity team at [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).

I currently work at the [Centre for Collective Intelligence Design](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/centre-collective-intelligence-design) at [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk), where we're building some exciting new tools to help communities and groups of people devise solutions together.

I'm a volunteer and founder of [Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org), and keen [puzzle gamer](https://escapethereview.co.uk/profile/?user_id=11).

This is a personal blog, and a place to share articles and ideas.
