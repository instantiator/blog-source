I am a tech lead and senior software developer. My career reflects my passion for public service and volunteerism.

I'm proud of the work I've done for the One Login for Government (Digital Identity) programme at [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), and I currently work at the [Centre for Collective Intelligence Design](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/centre-collective-intelligence-design) at [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk).

I'm a volunteer and founder of [Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org), and keen [puzzle gamer](https://escapethereview.co.uk/profile/?user_id=11).

This is a personal blog, and a place to share articles and ideas.
